Cardiogenic Shock
# Parasternal Long-Axis
* LVOTd
* LVEDD
* Mitral valve regurgitation assessment
# Parasternal Short-Axis (mid-papillary)
* Regional wall motion assessment
# A4C/5C
* LVOT VTI
* RV TAPSE
## Post-scan expected data:
* LVEDD normal or high
* Cardiac output by LVOT VTI low
* Regional wall motion abnormality
* Normal or concurrent RV failure (TAPSE)
* If previously reported “normal EF%” must exclude moderate to severe MR
  * CO by doppler will supersede this as this is forward flow only
