Limited Scan Protocol for Mitral and Aortic Valves
# PLAX
* check for effusion
* MV 2D qualitative assessment - thickening, diastolic doming, hockey stick
* MV regurgitation - colour flow doppler
  * VC < 3mm = mild MR
  * VC > 7mm = severe MR
  * eccentric jet - at least moderate MR
  * **posterior severe MR + peri-arrest may suggest SAM/LVOTO**
* AV 2D qualitative assessment - calcification, restriction
  * maximal aortic cusp separation (>1.2cm unlikely severe AS)
* AV regurg - colour flow doppler, measure VC or LVOT:jet width ratio
  * VC < 3mm = mild AR
  * VC > 6mm = severe AR
  * LVOT:jet < 25% = mild AR
    * 25-65% mod AR
    * > 65% severe AR
# PSAX
* mitral valve planimetry - 2D trace of maximal MV opening area
  * > 1.5cm2 - mild MS/normal
  * 1-1.5cm2 - moderate MS
  * < 1cm2 - severe MS
# Apical 4/5 chamber view
* MV 2d - as per PLAX
* MV regurg - as per PLAX
* MV mean pressure gradient - contiuous wave Doppler through mitral valve
  * trace valve inflow envelope (E and A wave)
  * MPG < 5mmHg = mild MS
  * MPG 5-10mmHg = mod MS
  * MPG > 10mmHg = severe MS
* LVOT VTI - pulsed wave Doppler 0.5-1.0cm from AV on ventricular side
* AV mean pressure gradient - continuous wave Doppler through AV
  * trace valve outflow envelope
  * MPG < 20mmHg = mild AS (assuming normal LV function)
  * MPG 20-40 = mod AS
  * MPG > 40mmHg = severe AS
